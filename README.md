# Java-DSA 🚀

This repository is my personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implementations and practice problems in **Java**.
I created it to strengthen my problem-solving skills, understand core computer science concepts, and prepare for coding interviews at top companies.

## 📌 About the Repository

* Covers **fundamental DSA topics** with clean and modular Java code.
* Organized topic-wise for easy navigation and reference.
* Includes **sorting algorithms, recursion, binary search problems, bit manipulation, pattern problems, and more**.
* Written with **clarity and comments** so concepts are easy to revisit in the future.

## 🧑‍💻 Topics Covered

* **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Cyclic Sort
* **Binary Search**: 1D & 2D arrays, recursion-based interview questions
* **Recursion**: Classic recursion problems & patterns
* **Bitwise Operators & Math Tricks**
* **Pattern Printing Problems** (to build logic)

## 🎯 Goals of this Repository

* Build a **strong foundation** in DSA with Java.
* Prepare for **coding interviews** and competitive programming.
* Improve **problem-solving skills** through hands-on coding.
* Keep a **reference library** of implementations for quick revision.

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeWithJatinSh/Java-DSA.git
   ```
2. Open in **IntelliJ IDEA** (or any Java IDE).
3. Run the desired file from the topic folder.
